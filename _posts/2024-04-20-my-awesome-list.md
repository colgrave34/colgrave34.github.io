# Operating Systems
## Desktop Linux Distros
Here are desktop distros that I recommend for new users
### [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/)

If you want a nearly vanilla distro, Fedora is your choice.

But, life isn't perfect. Sometimes we have to use Windows.  
We cannot get rid of every possible problems with Windows, but we can make it better. 

# Networking

### [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/)
The only open-source web browser that still has competition with Chrome.

Apart from all the Web3 feature, it's a solid browser for someone that don't really want to mess with their browser. 

### [ungoogled-chromium](https://github.com/ungoogled-software/ungoogled-chromium)
Vanilla Chromium but without all Google dependency. 

## Search Engines
